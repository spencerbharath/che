   * A Bézier curve is a parametric curve frequently used in computer graphics and related fields.
   * In vector graphics, Bézier curves are used to model smooth curves that can be scaled
   * indefinitely.
   *
   * <p>Four points x1, x2, x3 and x4 in the plane or in higher-dimensional space define a cubic
   * Bézier curve. The curve starts at x1 going toward x2 and arrives at x4 coming from the
   * direction of x3. Usually, it will not pass through x2 or x3; these points are only there to
   * provide directional information. The distance between x1 and x2 determines "how far" and "how
   * fast" the curve moves towards x2 before turning towards x3.
