/**
 * Describes a mechanism for checking ws agent's state. It needs when Workspace Agent (WS Agent)
 * stops to respond and projects disappear from the project tree, and the page shows 'Cannot get
 * project types' error. It may happens for example, when OOM happens in a WS Agent and kernel kills
 * WS Agent process. Problem here that we can't detect properly OOM error but we can check if WS
 * Agent is alive for user.
 *
 * <p>If client (IDE) lost WebSocket connection to the WS Agent - in this case IDE will request some
 * other service in our infrastructure to check WS Agent state, here we have two ways:
 *
 * <p>1/ WS Agent was shutdown by OS. If it not available for this service too, a user should be
 * notified that the workspace is broken probably because of OOM (it will be just suggest because we
 * not sure about reason).
 *
 * <p>2/ WS Agent is working well and is accessible for our infrastructure, in this case user has
 * networking problem. It can be not well configured proxy server or other problems which are not
 * related to our responsibility.
